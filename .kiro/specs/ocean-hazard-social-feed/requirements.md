# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ocean Hazard Social Feed is a mobile-first web application designed to help coastal residents, citizens, and authorities during ocean-related hazards such as tsunamis, cyclones, storm surges, high waves, and coastal flooding. The app provides a social media-style platform where citizens can report incidents by uploading photos/videos with automatic geotagging, while authorities and users can view real-time maps of hotspots where incidents are reported. The frontend will be built using React and TailwindCSS with mock data for demonstration purposes.
